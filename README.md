The objective of this project is to build a web application that allows users to input text or upload a text file and convert it into audio. The app will read the text aloud using a synthesized voice, allowing users to listen to the content directly on the page. This project will involve working with the Web Speech API or a third-party text-to-speech (TTS) API to process and play the audio, and it can also include additional features like adjusting the voice speed or selecting different voices.
